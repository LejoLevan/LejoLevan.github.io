            The following HTML is for testing the <strong> tag which creates Bold Text as well as
            the <em> tag which creates Italic text 

                Below paragraph was randomly generated using an online tool for the purposes of testing 
                the previously mentioned tags

                    Note for future reference, <strong> and <em> tags are visually equivalent to <b> and
                    <i> tags. The difference is that <strong> and <em> add importance to text which is 
                    important for accessibility

            <p>
                <strong>Housework could be everyone’s work, 
                not just “women’s work”.</strong>  
                Why do women enable men to act oblivious to cleaning, grocery shopping, 
                pet feeding, etc? Somehow when men live alone they figure 
                out how to do all of those things all on their own. 
                <em>My friend’s husband claimed he didn’t know that sheets 
                should be washed more than once a season. He said he didn’t 
                know one had to clean toilets.</em> He assumed that since you flush 
                toilets they clean themselves. She tried to get him to help but he did an 
                awful job so she let him off the hook. <strong> Wouldn’t it be better if she spent 
                the time and energy to get him to do it right instead of <em>letting him claim</em> 
                he is “just bad at it”.</strong> My sons were raised to clean toilets and change their own sheets. 
                Hopefully, in their future homes, the housework will be equally divided.

                a mispellling will still redirect the user

                Also important to include alt (stands for alternative text) within the img tag for accessiblity reasons
